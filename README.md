>this is the source code for waxweaver<br/>
>it uses c++ gdextension, so it must be opened in godot 4.2 or it won't work<br/>
>just the "theSandbox" folder is required if you would like to open the project<br/>
>"src" contains the c++ code which pertains to blocks and world generation and other intensive stuff<br/>
>you'll have to figure out how to compile the c++ code yourself if you'd like to play around with that stuff<br/>

>I NEVER GAVE THIS A LISCENSE SO UHH
>basically do whatever the hell u want with the code just no commercial use. I never made money off of waxweaver so neither can you !
