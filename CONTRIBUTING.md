## Ways to Contribute
We love new contributors!

### Improve the Documentation
Improving documentation is a great way to learn the codebase. Adding documentation to both the wiki and comments to the code eases the learning curve for both modders and new programmers.

## Reporting Bugs
Start an "Issue"

## Guidelines for Commit Messages
Nothing you write in the commit messages should EVER warrant a section like this existing and describing every way you can be nasty.
